        Today’s recipe is bibimbap, a super-popular Korean dish you might have heard about already!
         It’s made of a bowl of rice, sautéed and seasoned vegetables (namul: 나물), 
        a bit of hot pepper paste (gochujang: 고추장), and usually a bit of seasoned raw beef, 
        too (yukhoe: 육회).
    </p>
    <p>
        Bibim (비빔) translates as “mixed,” and bap (밥) means “cooked rice,” 
        so bibimbap literally means “mixed rice.” Before eating it you’re supposed to mix everything 
        all together.
